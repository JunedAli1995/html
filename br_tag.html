    <p><b>In 1992</b> <br>Tim Berners-Lee circulated a document titled <i>“HTML Tags,”</i><br> which outlined <u>just 20</u> tags <br> many of which are now obsolete or have taken other forms. <br> The first surviving tag to be defined in the document <br> after the crucial anchor tag, is the paragraph tag. <br> It wasn’t until 1993 that a discussion emerged on the proposed image tag.</p>
